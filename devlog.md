I have just finished reading the instructions and am starting to plan how I will implement the project. I think the most important thing to do at the beggining is to create the basic structure / skeleton of the project and when everything is working I will start to add more features, so I'll start by creating a simple program that can read the input file and print the data to the console and move on from there.

I have just finished creating the basic structure of the project and I am now starting to implement the functions. I started with the `create` command and fully implemented it. I also started on the `insert` command but I haven't finished it yet. I'm also starting the process of restructuring my project by splitting the b-tree and io functions from the main file, as well as the constants and other helper functions.

Today I plan on finishing the `insert` command, which implies that I need to work on the b-tree implementation. I'll start by creating the b-tree structure and then I will implement the functions for the other commands.

I have just finished the restructuring of the project. I created constants and utils files and modified the Makefile to handle the new structure and it still works. Later on today I will continue working on the `insert` command and hopefully finish a basic b-tree implementation by tonight.
